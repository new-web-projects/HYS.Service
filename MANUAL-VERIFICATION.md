# Manual Verification — Parts 2 & 3

Required whenever something can't be automatically verified. Everything
below needs real internet access this sandboxed environment doesn't have
(only package-registry domains are reachable here — not
`binaries.prisma.sh`, which Prisma's CLI needs for `generate`/`migrate`).
Nothing here is expected to fail — it's the same first-run experience any
fresh clone of a Prisma project has — but it hasn't been run for real yet,
so it isn't claimed as verified until you (or Codespaces) run it.

---

### 1. Prisma Client generation

**What to test:** `npx prisma generate` reads `prisma/schema.prisma` and
`prisma.config.ts` and writes the generated client.
**Where:** project root, after `npm install`.
**Expected result:** completes with no errors; creates
`lib/generated/prisma/` (gitignored — regenerated, never committed). No
network needed beyond the one-time engine download on first run.
**Actual result:** not run — blocked by this sandbox's network allowlist.
**Status:** ⬜ PASS / ⬜ FAIL — *to be filled in after you run it.*
**Required config:** none beyond what's already in `.env.example`.

### 2. Initial migration

**What to test:** `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` diffs the (empty)
database against `schema.prisma` and applies the first migration.
**Where:** project root, `DATABASE_URL`/`DIRECT_URL` pointing at a running
Postgres (`docker compose up -d` gives you one on `localhost:5432` with the
credentials already in `.env.example`).
**Expected result:** creates `prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_init/`, applies
it, and reports success. The resulting schema should match what this Part
verified by hand: **24 tables, 15 enum types** (see the table list under
"How this Part was verified" in the README — `skills`/`gender` are new
columns on existing tables, not new tables; `Gender` is the one new enum).
**Actual result:** not run — same network limitation as above.
**Status:** ⬜ PASS / ⬜ FAIL
**Required config:** `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` in `.env.local`.

### 3. Full production build

**What to test:** `npm run build` after steps 1–2 have run.
**Where:** project root.
**Expected result:** succeeds cleanly. Part 3's own build attempt (in this
sandbox) got exactly one error —
`Cannot find module './generated/prisma/client'` — and nothing else; that
error should be gone once step 1 has actually generated that module. If any
*other* error appears here, that's new and worth reporting back, since it
wouldn't be the known/expected one.
**Actual result:** not run to completion (see Part 3 summary for the
partial result this sandbox *could* produce).
**Status:** ⬜ PASS / ⬜ FAIL
**Required config:** same as above.

### 4. Local services via Docker Compose

**What to test:** `docker compose up -d` brings up Postgres and Redis with
passing healthchecks.
**Where:** project root.
**Expected result:** `docker compose ps` shows both `postgres` and `redis`
as `healthy` within ~10 seconds.
**Actual result:** not run — this sandbox has no Docker daemon. (Postgres
and Redis themselves *were* verified directly, just installed as native
packages rather than through Compose — see the README's verification
section for what that covered.)
**Status:** ⬜ PASS / ⬜ FAIL
**Required config:** Docker / Docker Compose installed (already true in
Codespaces).

### 5. Codespaces end-to-end

**What to test:** opening the repo in a fresh GitHub Codespace runs
`postCreateCommand` (`npm install && npx prisma generate`) automatically
and the dev server comes up clean.
**Where:** GitHub Codespaces.
**Expected result:** container builds, both extra services in
`docker-compose.yml` are healthy, `npm run dev` serves the homepage and
`/api/health` on the forwarded port.
**Actual result:** not run — this was built and verified outside Codespaces
itself.
**Status:** ⬜ PASS / ⬜ FAIL
**Required config:** a GitHub account with Codespaces access; no other
credentials needed for this Part specifically.

If step 1 or 2 fails with something other than a plain network/timeout
error, paste the output back — that would mean something in
`prisma.config.ts` or `schema.prisma` needs adjusting against whatever the
installed Prisma version actually expects, which this sandbox couldn't
confirm directly (see the Part 3 summary).
